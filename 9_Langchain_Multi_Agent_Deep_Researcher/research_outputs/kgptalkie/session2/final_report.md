- Amazon's absolute revenue is much larger, driven by both products and a growing services segment particularly AWS, which contributes heavily to its operating income.

- Apple's business model with hardware products plus services yields high-margin revenue; Amazon operates on thinner margins typical of retail combined with high-margin cloud computing.

## Conclusion

In fiscal 2024, Apple and Amazon displayed distinct financial profiles. Apple, while generating lower total revenue, maintains much higher profitability margins indicating a high-margin, premium product and services strategy. Amazon commands a larger revenue base with robust growth, driven by scale in retail and AWS segments, albeit with lower profit margins typical of its diversified business model.

Investors and analysts should consider these complementary strengths when evaluating the two companies. Apple excels in profitability efficiency whereas Amazon leads in scale and growth momentum.
