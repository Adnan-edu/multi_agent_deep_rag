# Bulk Data Ingestion with Qdrant for Deep RAG

This project implements a robust, high-performance data ingestion pipeline that loads multimodal data into a Qdrant vector database. It supports hybrid search (Dense + Sparse) and handles various data types extracted from complex documents.

## Project Overview

The ingestion pipeline is designed to consolidate processed data—including text, tables, and image descriptions—into a single Qdrant collection. It features intelligent deduplication and rich metadata tagging to enable precise filtering and retrieval for Deep RAG applications.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Search Architecture**: Integrates Google Gemini (Dense) and BM25 (Sparse) embeddings for superior retrieval accuracy.
- **Multimodal Support**:
    - **Markdown**: Page-level text chunks.
    - **Tables**: Extracted table data with preserved context.
    - **Images**: Text descriptions generated by Multimodal LLMs.
- **Incremental Ingestion**: Uses SHA-256 file hashing to prevent duplicate uploads and support incremental updates.
- **Rich Metadata filtering**: Documents are tagged with company, year, quarter, document type, and page number for advanced filtering queries.

## Ingestion Workflow

1.  **Environment Setup**: Connect to Qdrant (Local or Cloud) and initialize embedding models.
2.  **Collection Configuration**: Create or update the Qdrant collection with optimized vector dimensions and search parameters.
3.  **Data Processing**:
    - **Metadata Extraction**: Automatically parses filenames to determine document context.
    - **Hashing**: Computes hashes for all files to maintain an ingestion registry.
4.  **Bulk Upload**:
    - Chunks markdown files based on page breaks.
    - Ingests tables and image descriptions with associated metadata.
5.  **Verification**: Performs similarity searches to validate the integrity and accessibility of the ingested data.
